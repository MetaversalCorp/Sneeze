# `CONTAINER::CID`

The identity record of a [`CONTAINER`](CONTAINER.md) — the small, copyable value that names a signed content source and decides how two sources compare. A `CID` is built by the [`CONTEXT`](../context/index.md) from a verified [`MSF`](../msf/index.md): its fields come from the source's signing certificate and manifest plus the current [persona](../persona/index.md). The container's pool key and display name are both derived from it. For the conceptual picture see the [Container system](../../systems/container.md) page; this page is the exact behavior of every public member.

```cpp
class CONTAINER::CID
{
public:
   std::string sFingerprint;
   std::string sOrganization;
   std::string sOrganizationHash;
   std::string sContainer;
   std::string sPersonaHash;
   eTRUST      eTrust;

   CID () : eTrust (kTRUST_NONE) {}

   std::string DisplayName () const;
   std::string Key_Org     () const;
   std::string Key_All     () const;
};
```

## Role and ownership

- **Built by** `CONTEXT::Container_Open`, which populates the fields from an MSF (or synthesizes a "Root" identity for the source-less root fabric) and assigns `eTrust`.
- **Copied into** the `CONTAINER` it identifies — the container keeps its own copy, returned by [`CONTAINER::Identity()`](CONTAINER.md).
- **Plain value type.** All fields are public; there is no pimpl and no internal locking. Treat it as an immutable record once built.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sFingerprint` | `std::string` | The signing certificate's fingerprint. The dominant component of the pooling key. |
| `sOrganization` | `std::string` | The human-readable organization name from the certificate. |
| `sOrganizationHash` | `std::string` | A hash standing in for the organization when its name is not trusted enough to display. |
| `sContainer` | `std::string` | The container name the source declared in its manifest. |
| `sPersonaHash` | `std::string` | The hash of the local persona under which the content is loaded — part of identity, so one persona's data never leaks into another's. |
| `eTrust` | `eTRUST` | The trust level (see [`eTRUST`](index.md#the-etrust-enum)); defaults to `kTRUST_NONE`. |

---

## Construction

```cpp
CID ();
```

### `CID()`
- **Purpose.** Construct an empty identity with `eTrust` defaulted to `kTRUST_NONE`. All string fields are empty.
- **Notes.** The context fills the fields in immediately after constructing one; you rarely build a `CID` yourself.

---

## Derived strings

```cpp
std::string DisplayName () const;
std::string Key_Org     () const;
std::string Key_All     () const;
```

### `std::string DisplayName () const`
- **Purpose.** The name a host shows the user for this source. Returns `organization/container` when the source is trusted enough (`eTrust >= kTRUST_EXPIRED`), and `organizationHash/container` otherwise — so an untrusted source cannot present a recognizable organization name.
- **Returns.** The display string.
- **Notes.** Because trust is currently forced to `kTRUST_EXPIRED` for MSF-derived containers (see [Container → Trust levels](../../systems/container.md#trust-levels)), `DisplayName` reflects that forced value, not the real verification result, until the override is removed.

### `std::string Key_Org () const`
- **Purpose.** The organization-tier identity prefix — the part of the path shared by every container under the same persona and fingerprint.
- **Returns.** A string of the form `persona/fp2/fp22`, composed from the first 12 characters of `sPersonaHash`, the first 2 characters of `sFingerprint`, and the next 22 characters of `sFingerprint`. Pieces shorter than expected are taken as far as available.
- **Notes.** Used by the org-scoped path accessors on `CONTAINER` (`Path_Permanent_Org` / `Path_Temporary_Org`), under which organization-scoped [storage](../storage/index.md) is filed.

### `std::string Key_All () const`
- **Purpose.** The pooling key — the string the context's container map is keyed by. Identical key means identical identity means one shared container.
- **Returns.** A string of the form `persona/fp2/fp22/container`, composed from `Key_Org()` plus `"/" + sContainer`.
- **Notes.** Built once and cached by the `CONTAINER` (returned by [`CONTAINER::Key()`](CONTAINER.md)). Note that `eTrust` is **not** part of the key — the same source at different trust levels still pools to one container.
